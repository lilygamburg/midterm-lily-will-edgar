[TITLE OF OUR PAPER](LINK TO THE PAPER) by Lily Gamburg, William Johnson, and Edgar Suritis.

Utilizing [NLPScholar](https://github.com/forrestdavis/NLPScholar/tree/main), we are replicating the results of [Cross-Linguistic Syntactic Evaluation of Word Prediction Models](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.490.pdf), by Mueller et al.

Links to Components of the Project:

* Original dataset used in Mueller et al.
[CLAMS Dataset](https://github.com/lilygamburg/midterm-lily-will-edgar/blob/main/clams.zip)

* Data Files (.tsv) Passed into NLPScholar:
  [Minimum Pairs](https://github.com/lilygamburg/midterm-lily-will-edgar/blob/main/min_pair_sentences.zip)
  and [Code to Produce Sentences](https://github.com/lilygamburg/midterm-lily-will-edgar/blob/main/produce_min_pair_sentences.py)

* Configuration (.yaml) Files
  [Config Files by Language](https://github.com/lilygamburg/midterm-lily-will-edgar/tree/main/NLPScholar_setup)

* Results By Language:
